## French-English Flash Card Game

This is a flash card game designed to help users learn and guess the English meanings of French words. Created during my early days of learning Python, this project utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface and Pandas for managing the dataset of French and English word pairs. The game displays a French word on a flash card, and the user has to guess its English meaning. It's a great tool for practicing vocabulary and a fun way to enhance language learning. Check out the code, try the game, and share your thoughts!😁😁
